# Analysis of Wallet Credit Scores

## Score Distribution
The distribution of wallet credit scores shows a clear separation between high-quality wallets and riskier wallets. Most wallets score between 800-1000, indicating reliable, responsible usage.

## Low-Score Wallets
Wallets with scores below 200 typically have:
- Frequent liquidations
- Low repay to borrow ratios
- High borrow to deposit ratios
- Large repayment delays

## High-Score Wallets
Wallets with scores above 900 are characterized by:
- Consistent repayments
- No liquidations
- Stable borrowing and depositing behavior
- Longer activity duration

## Recommendations
This scoring model can be used as a first filter in credit risk analysis for DeFi lending.
Further improvements may include integrating off-chain data or more advanced temporal features.
